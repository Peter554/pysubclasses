# Additional Instructions

- Write idiomatic rust code that is simple as possible. Avoid excessive abstraction.
- All code should have tests (unit and/or integration tests).
- Look for opportunities to refactor, simplify and improve your code.
- Ensure that documentation is up to date with the code.
- When you're done making changes test, lint and format the code to check everything.
